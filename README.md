# Her3 knockout in zebrafish - RNAseq analysis

--------

## Overview

This is the code used to run the RNAseq analysis for the Her3 knockout in zebrafish. The easiest way to view the analysis is to look at kentRNAseq1.html in a browser. This code is meant not as a plug-and-play pipeline for running RNAseq analysis, but rather to document the steps involved in running this analysis.
