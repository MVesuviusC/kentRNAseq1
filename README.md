# Her3 knockout in zebrafish - RNAseq analysis

--------

## Overview

This is the code used to run the RNAseq analysis for the her3 knockout in
zebrafish. The easiest way to view the analysis is to look at kentRNAseq1.html
in a browser. This code is meant not as a plug-and-play pipeline for running
RNAseq analysis, but rather to document the steps involved in running this
analysis.

The code to run this analysis can be found in kentRNAseq1.Rmd. It may be easier
to view the code by downloading kentRNAseq1.html and viewing it in a browser.

All sbatch commands used in the analysis are in the sbatchCmds folder and any
code for other scripts are viewable in the source code blocks of the html file.

If you have questions on the study, please contact Matt Kent or Genevieve Kendall.
